###### One of the most criticized aspects of Western education is the lack of required curriculum concerning money and the economy. It is also no coincidence that the UN dedicates 4 of its 17 SDGs to topics surrounding development in industry. Beyond this, the main issue preventing the other SDGs from being achieved is money. The point of sustainable development is to find a balance that turns short term sacrifices into long term success, but - far too often - we see that resources are not always being used to their full potential. As citizens, students, potential workers and future taxpayers, we understand the vitality of ensuring that our generation is well informed in regard to topics surrounding national economic and industrial affairs, and we hope to inspire a generation of leaders that knows how to responsibly manage money in order to promote sustainable development across the globe.
